The version uploaded to this repository is v87, which is a new test version. The test server is still at the previous version 86. I will update the Game Server to the same version when I have tested the version more. Thanks.

22/11/2023
Unfortunately there were major errors when saving Players. For this reason I had to wipe the Server data. Old accounts will need to be re-created and Players will have to start from new again. My sincere apologies however this was a necessary step as the data save process corrupted accounts and did not let the users in again once created. Thanks for understanding.

Note - Report any bugs to the issue tracker here: https://github.com/Langerz82/roguequest/issues
